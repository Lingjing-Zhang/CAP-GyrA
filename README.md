# Introduction
This study proposes a GNN model (chemical activity prediction of GyrA, CAP-GyrA) based on a two-stream neural network architecture, which integrates chemical and BRICS molecular fragment structural representations. The model is designed to predict the inhibitory activity of chemicals on GyrA, enabling rapid screening of high-risk environmental pollutants with the potential to induce quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli.
