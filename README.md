# Introduction
This study proposes a GNN model (chemical activity prediction of GyrA, CAP-GyrA) based on a two-stream neural network architecture, which integrates chemical and BRICS molecular fragment structural representations. The model is designed to predict the inhibitory activity of chemicals on GyrA of Escherichia coli.
